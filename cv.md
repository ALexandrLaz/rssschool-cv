## About Me

At the moment, my goal is to change the field of activity, I have been at my current place of work for 6 years. I believe that I was able to achieve everything that I could in this job, so I want to realize myself in a more promising and interesting direction. During my work, I have established myself as a responsible and executive employee who is able to fulfill the tasks assigned to me. I have no commercial experience in programming, but I strive to learn everything new and interesting for myself. In August I finished courses on Front-end development from the computer academy "ItStep".

## My skills

At the moment I do not have much experience and skills in commercial programming, knowledge of frameworks and databases. However, I will fix this shortcoming soon. 
**But now i have skills in:**
    * HTML,
    * CSS,
    * Git,
    * JavaScript.

## Some code

```
function createElem(name, className, event, fn) {
  let element = document.createElement(name);
  if (className != undefined) {
    element.className = className;
  }
  if (event != undefined && fn != undefined) {
    element.addEventListener(event, fn);
  }
  element.setAttribute("id", idItem);
  originBoard.push(idItem);
  idItem++;
  return element;
}; 
```

## My education

I graduated from BSUIR with a degree in micro-electronic technologies and systems in 2015. He has been working as a specialty since 2014, having got a job in a private company. Until now, I have been working for this company. As I said earlier, I am currently taking courses on JavaScript development.

## My english level

My *English* level is **A2**, from practice I only had courses and communication with foreign partners.
